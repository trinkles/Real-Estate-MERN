Applied MERN concepts on real estate webapp from [React & Next js Projects with Sahand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAaUy_Moivw).

Environment, tools, libraries, and frameworks used:

Frontend
- Vite + React (w/ Javascript + SWC)
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router Dom (to import BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, and Link)
- React Icons

Backend
- Express
- Nodemon
- Mongoose
- Dotenv
- BcryptJS

Notes:
- Move repo by using `mv git`
- Add `.env` file to `.gitignore` to store passwords safely

and more... to be added later.
